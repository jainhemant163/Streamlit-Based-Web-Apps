## Tensorboard

TensorBoard provides the visualization and tooling needed for machine learning experimentation:
- Tracking and visualizing metrics such as loss and accuracy
- Visualizing the model graph (ops and layers)
- Viewing histograms of weights, biases, or other tensors as they change over time
- Projecting embeddings to a lower dimensional space
- Displaying images, text, and audio data
- Profiling TensorFlow programs

### Getting Started 

Detailed step-by-step instructions are available in `tensorboard_tutorial.ipynb`. Run the notebook on your local Jupyter Server or Google Colab and follow the steps outlined in the notebook.
